\subsection{CvitanoviÄ‡ 1988}

We present ome key facts about UPOs from \cite{Cvitanovic1988}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Their symbol sequences and topological invariants.
    \item Their eigenvalues are metric invariants. These eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of the jacobians along the orbit.
    \item Short UPOs alone can approximate properties of strange attractors, longer ones are just refinements.
    \item They're robust, the eigenvalues of short UPOs vary smoothly with smooth parameter choices.
    \item Asymptotic averages are given by UPO expansions??
    \item Errors associated with not using long cycles fall exponentially with cycle length.
    \item We can find short UPOs experimentally.
    \item It is unclear when/if they are enough for a complete description of a dynamical system.
\end{itemize}
